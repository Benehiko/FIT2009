# FIT2009 Data structures and algorithms
Monash FIT2009 Unit Code Examples Packaged by Topic.

## Information
Code examples and wiki information will be posted here

Contribution is much appreciated.

After some investigation I believe that submodules would work the most optimal since there are different tasks / labs etc.
You can thus create private github repositories when working on a lab and then expose it to the public after the week has passed to 'release answers', then sub-module it into the forked repository from where you can do a pull request into this repository.

**Please look at 'Submodules'**

## IDE I use
I use IntelliJ as it provides support for Node.js and has a really nice interface. 
.. and Free for students ;)
